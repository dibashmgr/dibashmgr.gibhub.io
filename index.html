            Muna Madan follows the life of Madan, a
             Chhetri man from Kathmandu who leaves Muna, his wife, to go to Lhasa to 
             earn a fortune. He is cautioned against leaving by both Muna and his elderly mother, but he decides to leave anyway. While 
             he initially intends to spend just a few weeks in Lhasa, he spends a longer time there, becoming entranced by the city's beauty. 
             He finally sets off for Kathmandu but falls sick with cholera on the way. His travelling 
             companion, Ram, returns to Kathmandu and tells Muna that her husband has died.

            But Madan is rescued by a 'Bhote', a Tibetan man. Tibet is called 'Bhot' in the Nepali language, drawn from the classical 
            Tibetan name for Tibet, Bod. The Tibetan nurses Madan back to health, leading Madan to realize that men are great not because of 
            their castes but because of their hearts.[7] In the Nepali Hindu caste system, a Tibetan, as a meat-eating Buddhist, would have been
            considered 'untouchable' by devout Hindus. The couplet uttered by Madan while touching the Tibetan's feet, a sign of great respect 
            in Khas Nepali culture, has since taken on the status of modern proverbs, often uttered by Nepalis in their daily speech.

        Before Muna Madan, Devkota had primarily been influenced by the English Romantics, but with this poem.<br><br><br><br>
        <br/>
        He took a quintessentially Nepali folk tradition as his inspiration, <b>the jhyaure meter.[3]</b><br> 
        Devkota was reportedly was inspired to write a poem in jhyaure by 
        <i>the singing of women plating rice in the fields during the Nepali 
        month of Asar.[2][3]</i><br> 
        <u>He chose to write in Asare Jhyaure, the poetic meter of central Nepali rice-planting songs.[9] </u><br>
        <em>His choice of the jhyaure meter was a controversial one, </em><br>
        <strong>as the folk meter was associated among Kathmandu's literary elite with flirtation and the erotic.</strong>
        <hr>
        <a href="https://www.google.com"target=" blank">Stirr argues that the poem "created a link between
        his elite world and the worlds of ordinary Nepali people of various castes and ethnic groups</a>, bringing hallmarks of folk
        song and vernacular erotic poetry into a refined atmosphere where meticulous Sanskrit aesthetics and Brahminical Hindu 
        morality were the norms."
